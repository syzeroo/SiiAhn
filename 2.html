<h2>ABOUT</h2>
<p>As such, I am going to look into the ‘Hydro Scotland’ from the micro to the macro perspective for the next stage. In particular, when I approached from user experiences, ‘Hydro Trail’ can be considered within more innovative ways beyond linking companies and sites and it should be one of the way of bringing the value of water which has great potential in creative and cultural aspects in Scotland.</p>
<p>Through my study on this course, my ultimate interests and skill is mostly about visualising research and structures to support abstract and intangible concepts, hence I would like to learn and practice for deeper understanding of the visual methodologies. With this in mind I feel your involvement and advice will be a great opportunity for the project and myself.</p>

<h2>about</h2>
<p>Background - Interior design (south Korea) and currently studying service design for masters in GSA.  While I was studying in interior design, I realised interior designer’s concerns not only
what is inside the space, but also how people interact within the space.
Therefore “How should i design a space” is more likely to be “How can I create a better experience for people” and those thinking motivated me to study more about service design.</p>

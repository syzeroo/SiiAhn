<h2>PORTFOLIO</h2>
<p>I am writing to ask for you to discuss the possibility of being my supervisor for Semester 3 as you were a main studio tutor for the “Soft Power” project and your PhD in Information Design is the most relevant study for my development of Thesis in Semester 3.<p/>
<p>My MDes theme will be an extension of the “<a href="https://www.environment.gov.scot/educational-resources/get-learning/water/"

  target+"_blank" title="html5
  specification">Hydro Scotland</a>” which has been already explored during Semester 1. As you know, our team were able to receive positive feedbacks from the Scottish Government and I believe in the potential for this concept to become reality. However, apart from generating a business model, I still feel there are several aspects to be studied and researched as it was such a huge suggestion within the short time.</p>

<p>As such, I am going to look into the ‘Hydro Scotland’ from the micro to the macro perspective for the next stage. In particular, when I approached from user experiences, ‘Hydro Trail’ can be considered within more innovative ways beyond linking companies and sites and it should be one of the way of bringing the value of water which has great potential in creative and cultural aspects in Scotland.</p>
<p>Through my study on this course, my ultimate interests and skill is mostly about visualising research and structures to support abstract and intangible concepts, hence I would like to learn and practice for deeper understanding of the visual methodologies. With this in mind I feel your involvement and advice will be a great opportunity for the project and myself.</p>
